# Quantum_Galton_Board_Project
The project presents a quantum version of the Galton Board (a device used to demonstrate probability and the normal distribution) and shows how to implement it on a quantum computer more efficiently.Although- there exist the classical approach in which a ball hits the peg and produces a 50% probability of going left or right, then hitting another peg on the board. After many drops, the ball forms a bell-shaped (normal) distribution at the bottom. In the quantum Galton board, instead of hitting (simulating) each ball path one by one, a quantum computer can put all possible paths into superposition and process them at once. This means exponential speed up of 2n2 path can be calculated using only O (n2) resources.
Below is the picture of classical vs quantum probabilty distribution of the experiment.

The workflow of the project is as follows:
(i) Introduction
(ii)The flow of the Quantum Galton Board
(iii)Steps by steps plan implementation in Qiskit.

The two files here are (i) The summary of the project in PDF (ii) the implementation in Jupiter notebook
